- This is my first Streamlit app.
- I trained a machine learning model on some features to predict premier league match results.
- In this app, you can choose the following features:
  - Home team
  - Opponent team
  - Date of the match
  - Time of the match
  - Is it played at home or away
  - Formation of home team.
  - Captain of the home team.

- This model is not so good and it's not reliable, but we can do some work on it and improve it more in the future.
- Maybe after some improvements you can use it for your purpose to win points in Fantasy game :)

I hope you enjoy playing and predicting.
